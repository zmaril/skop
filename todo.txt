WidgetType feels repitive.

Save widget config after each interaction? 

Make collapse saving work. Just not working right now, because th estate isn't part of the widget config, it's part of egui directly. 


Persistence is better but eh. 

Make it possible to edit color and name. 
Add overview of things to investigation list. 

Pause everything button. 

Can widget_type in mod be typechecked? 
Remove num_cpus? 

Add the ping stuff back in 

Make hosts be configurable, connections, unsure. Let's say hosts for now and have them be configured per investiatoin and then selectable per widget via dropdown,. 


CLick events on investigation row sucks

ps output might be parsed working
for refreshed commands, check if the data is comiing in all together or in batches
